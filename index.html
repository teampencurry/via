  <p>Like you once said, I'm just curious about you,</p> 
  <p> but I'm still hoping amidst all the uncertainty, and I'll keep on waiting for you.</p>
  <p> Like what Lana Del Rey sang, "If you go, I'll stay, You come back, I'll be right here."</p>

  <p>By the way, whatever you've told me before, if it brings you joy, go ahead and keep doing it.</p>
  <p> thanks for the 50523 moments, They might have been short, but they're still pretty rad memories for me.</p> 
  <p> It feels awesome to be there for you and make you happy.</p> 
  <p> I can't really tell if it's real happiness or just a fleeting impression.</p>
  <p> Maybe I'm assuming too much, especially considering you were going through a tough time back then...  ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>

   <p>But, I just wanted to drop by and say happy birthday! </p>
   <p>May your life be like La vie en rose, </p>
   <p>and may God always have your back in everything you do. ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>
